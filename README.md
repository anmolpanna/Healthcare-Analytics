## Diabetes Prevalence Analysis in Ontario
### Project Overview:
This project analyzes the prevalence of diabetes in Ontario, Canada, focusing on demographic trends and population changes. The analysis was conducted using data sourced from Public Health Canada (PHAC) and covers key factors such as age groups, sex, and fiscal year trends.

### Objectives:
To understand how diabetes prevalence changes over time.
To identify high-risk groups based on age and sex.
To forecast future prevalence trends using time-series analysis.

### Data:
The dataset used in this project includes variables such as geographic location (Ontario), age groups, sex, and prevalence rates (%) of diabetes over several years. The data underwent extensive cleaning to handle missing values and ensure consistency in variable formats.

### Analysis:
Descriptive Statistics: Summarizes the dataset to highlight key demographic insights.
Time-Series Analysis: Observes trends over the years using ARIMA models to forecast future diabetes prevalence.
Cross-Sectional Analysis: Compares prevalence across different age and sex groups.
Correlation and ANOVA: Evaluates the relationship between variables like age, sex, and prevalence.
Linear Regression Model: Predicts diabetes prevalence based on year, age group, and sex.

### Key Findings:
Males and older age groups (65â€“79 and 80+) have higher diabetes prevalence.
Ontario experienced the highest increase in diabetes prevalence across Canada.
The forecast suggests that diabetes prevalence will continue to increase, particularly among older populations.

## Tools Used:
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels)
Linear Regression and ARIMA for forecasting
Data Visualization for trends and comparative analysis
